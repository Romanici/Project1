# Project 1
Data Science Udacity Nanodegree


## Project Motivation
For this project, I analyse data from the platform Airbnb for Barcelona with the aim of answering the following questions:
+ How the activity has been affected by the pandemic.
+ The evolution of prices during the last year 
+ Which kind of listings have been more impacted by the pandemic. 
Therefore, I look into the two most important characteristics of a market: quantity and price.


## File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase the code used to answer the above questions. There are also several .csv files which contain the data needed. 


## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://afagustin7.medium.com/analyzing-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-barcelonas-airbnb-market-844d9425706f).
